### evolutionary-algorithms-from-scratch-v1.ipynb
* Contains version-1.0 of the main program which tries to implement an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the classic knapsack problem
* The evolutionary algorithm is compared to a brute force approach to highlight the performance gain
* Several statistics of the search are displayed in real-time such as iterations, generations, success rate etc.
* Automated graph generation is available in two options: value increase per generation and one-hot encoding scheme
* A testing system is also employed to check the overall success rate over multiple runs
